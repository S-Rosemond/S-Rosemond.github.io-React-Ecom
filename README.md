Free code camp React e-com tutorial.

I am using this tutorial to explore React as a guide(extra credit) for the solo project: the grip-project: where I am figuring out how to use third party components while having a deadline of March to complete the project. Afterwards, I'll return to the expensify app tutorial which uses Redux but not before expanding my ability to solve algorithms and maybe Vue.js(the crash course made it seem easier to grasp v React). This tutorial uses netilfy, so it seemed win-win as opposed to using Redux and firebase.

Let's rock, paper, scissors! Lego.
